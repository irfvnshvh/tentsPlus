Concept: About Tents Plus
An inventory management system made for easy administration and inventory tracking for administrators and case workers of TentsPlus

Design Process
Following the two phases of any mobile app design, 
1. Mobile app design strategy
2. App design process

We figured out our problem statements, purpose, solutions and target audience.
Through this process, we ruled out the benefits that the end-user will drive from using the app.

We started off by downloading a few rental and lifestyle apps to infer the design themes implemented,
and what similarities they had.

Moving forward, we inferred with the brief while drafting the first wireframes. After rounds of thorough discussion and constructive criticism, we made up several drafts to achieve our final set of wireframes. 

Our aim was to create an app with consideration to UI and UX. Our app has been designed minimally to well establish our ideal TentsPlus app.

What you want users to achieve 
Access the administrative and inventory information.
Keep in track with their payments to make more informed decisions.
Update profile password.
